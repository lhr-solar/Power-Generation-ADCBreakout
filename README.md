# PowerGen-ADCBreakout
This repo holds all hardware design for the 2024-2026 MPPT voltage and current sensors. The main differences from the 2022-2024 design are the isolation of the microcontroller from the rest of the MPPT, and the use of a discrete ADC rather than the one on the Nucleo. 

UPDATES:
Schematic issues should be nearly hashed out. Have had a lot of people look at it now and I feel comfortable moving forward with the layout and printing. 

TODO:
-Create new iteration of board layout based on schematic changes and review.  
-Have Fun
